NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

- Numpy arrays are faster than lists
- written in python, c and c++

**Getting Started:**
```
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

**2-D Arrays:**
```
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(arr)
```

**Accessing arrays**
```
arr[0]              // for 1D Arrays
arr[0,Â 1]           // for 2D Arrays
```
